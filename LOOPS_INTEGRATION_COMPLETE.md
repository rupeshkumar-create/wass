## Implementation Details

### Loops Service Methods

#### Contact Sync Methods
```typescript
// Sync nominee (on approval)
await loopsService.syncNominee({
  email: 'nominee@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe',
  category: 'Top Recruiter',
  type: 'person',
  linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe'
});

// Sync nominator (on submission)
await loopsService.syncNominator({
  email: 'nominator@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  phone: '+1234567890',
  linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/in/janesmith'
});

// Sync voter (on vote)
await loopsService.syncVoter({
  email: 'voter@example.com',
  firstName: 'Bob',
  lastName: 'Johnson'
});
```

#### Event Methods
```typescript
// Nomination submitted event
await loopsService.sendNominationEvent(
  { email: 'nominator@example.com' },
  {
    category: 'Top Recruiter',
    nomineeId: 'uuid-123',
    nomineeName: 'John Doe',
    nomineeType: 'person'
  }
);

// Nomination approved event
await loopsService.sendNominationApprovedEvent(
  { email: 'nominee@example.com' },
  {
    category: 'Top Recruiter',
    nomineeId: 'uuid-123',
    nomineeName: 'John Doe',
    liveUrl: '/nominee/john-doe'
  }
);

// Vote cast event
await loopsService.sendVoteEvent(
  { email: 'voter@example.com' },
  {
    category: 'Top Recruiter',
    nomineeId: 'uuid-123',
    nomineeSlug: 'john-doe',
    nomineeName: 'John Doe'
  }
);
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Nomination Submission
**File**: `src/app/api/nominations/route.ts`

When a nomination is submitted:
- ✅ Nominator is synced to "Nominator 2026" group
- ✅ "nomination_submitted" event is sent to nominator
- ✅ Non-blocking async execution (doesn't delay response)

#### 2. Nomination Approval
**File**: `src/app/api/nominations/route.ts` (PATCH method)

When a nomination is approved:
- ✅ Nominee is synced to "Nominees 2026" group (if email provided)
- ✅ "nomination_approved" event is sent to nominee
- ✅ Non-blocking async execution

#### 3. Vote Casting
**File**: `src/app/api/votes/route.ts` (existing)

When a vote is cast:
- ✅ Voter is synced to "Voter 2026" group
- ✅ "vote_cast" event is sent to voter

## Error Handling

### Graceful Failures
- All Loops sync operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failures are logged but don't block the main operation
- Uses fire-and-forget pattern with setTimeout for non-critical syncs

### Email Validation
- Nominee sync only occurs if email is provided
- Graceful skipping with logging when email is missing
- All other syncs require email (enforced by form validation)

### Retry Logic
- Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Handles network timeouts and API errors
